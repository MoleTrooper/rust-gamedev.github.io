Welcome to the 20th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Starframe]

![Current state of starframe graphics and physics](starframe.gif)

[Starframe] by [@moletrooper] is a work-in-progress game engine for physics-y
sidescrolling 2D games.

This month, its physics engine was revamped once more (for the last time,
hopefully), implementing a modern solver method called Extended Position-Based
Dynamics. Also, [a blog post][sf-blog-post] was published, covering the
development of the physics engine so far in a great deal of mathematical
detail.
